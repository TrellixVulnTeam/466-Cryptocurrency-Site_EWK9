{% block about %}
Litecoin is a revloutionary technology that has the ability to greatly enhance the lives of those with access to it.
Litecoin is a powerful tool for economic, social and political change that hands power back to individuals in a way
we
have not seen before. With decentralised systems of finance there are no gods or kings and no one to censor
transactions or financial activities. We are living in exciting times and believe everyone should have access to
the
new age of finance.
